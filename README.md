## Description:
For our project we are planning on creating a web application that picks a random restaurant for the user to eat at based on a set of parameters that can either be preset or passed in by the user. Also, users can create groups that our application will use to pick random restaurants which fit all the users' preferences.

## To Run
Sign up for a Yelp v2 API key. Clone this repository and run ```npm install```. Pass in your Yelp API keys as environment variables and then ```npm start```.

It should look like this: ```CONSUMER_KEY=yourkeyhere CONSUMER_SECRET=... npm start```

Go to http://localhost:3000/html/index.html and sign up for an account.
Feel free to adjust your food preferences and the next time you're hungry, don't forget to come back!
